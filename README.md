# unit-4-game

##### Instructions: 
You will be given a random number at the start of the game. Four crystals are displayed on the page, each with different values. The value of each crystal is hidden until you click on them. By clicking on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the total score. You win the game by matching your total score to the random number from the beginning of the game. If your total score goes above the random number, you lose. The game restarts whenever you win or lose.
